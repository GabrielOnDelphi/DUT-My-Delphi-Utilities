# DUT - LightSaber Delphi Utilities  

A set of tools that help you with your Delphi code:  
* Upgrade code from 32 to 64 bit (invalid pointer casts, etc).  
* Format your code.  
* Detect English spelling issues in DFM files.  
* Fix the CanFocus/SetFocus at batch.   
* Fix swallowed exceptions.  
* Find all classes that implement an interface.  
* Color picker.  
* Fix the broken CRLF.  
* Convert PAS files from ANSI to UTF8 and back.  
* etc  
  
All tools can be applied at batch to all files in the specified folder (and subfolders).
When something wrong (invalid typecast, for example) is detected in a PAS file, you can double-click that file, and the tool will send that file to the IDE.
